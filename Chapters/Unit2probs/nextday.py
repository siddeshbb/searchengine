# Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age in days. 
# Compensate for leap days. 
# Assume that the birthday and current date are correct dates (and no time travel). 
# Simply put, if you were born 1 Jan 2012 and todays date is 2 Jan 2012 
# you are 1 day old.
#
# Hint
# A whole year is 365 days, 366 if a leap year.

def nextDay(year, month, day):
    """
    Returns the year, month, day of the next day.
    Simple version: assume every month has 30 days.
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    day = day + 1
    if day >= 31:
        month = month + 1
        day = 1
    if month == 13:
        year = year + 1

    return year , month , day
