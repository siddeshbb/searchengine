# A leap year baby is a baby born on Feb 29, which occurs only on a leap year.

# For this question, you have to define a procedure is_leap_baby 
# which takes 3 inputs - day, month and year of birth of a comic book character
# and returns True if the character born in a leap year
# and False if the character isn't born in a leap year.

# Remember, a year that is a multiple of 4 is a leap year. 
# But, this isn't always true. 
# A year that is a multiple of 100 is NOT a leap year unless it is also 
# a multiple of 400.

def is_leap_baby(day,month,year):
    if (year%100 == 0) and (year%400 != 0):
        return False
    elif year%4 == 0:
        if (day == 29) and (month == 2):
            return True
        else:
            return False
    
    else:
        return False
        
        
   
# The function 'output' prints one of two statements based on whether 
# the is_leap_baby function returned True or False.

def output(status,name):
    if status:
        print "%s is one of an extremely rare species. He is a leap year baby!"%name
    else:
        print "There's nothing special about %s's birthday. He is not a leap year baby!"%name
